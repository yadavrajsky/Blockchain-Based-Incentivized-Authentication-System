# 🌐 Blockchain-Based Authentication and Incentive System

## Overview

The Blockchain-Based Authentication and Incentive System is a cutting-edge solution designed to elevate user authentication, security, and engagement for companies. By harnessing the power of blockchain technology, this system bids farewell to conventional authentication methods like email or usernames. Companies registering on the blockchain will deposit an initial asset, acting as an incentive for their active users.

## Features

### 📚 Blockchain Registration

- Companies register on the blockchain and deposit an initial asset.
- Blockchain ensures transparency, immutability, and trust in the registration process.

### 🔐 Wallet Address and Password Authentication

- User registration relies on a secure combination of wallet address and password, enhancing privacy and security.
- No need for traditional email or username-based authentication.

### ⏱️ Session Management

- Companies conduct user sessions, authenticate users, and track regular sessions.
- User login data is updated daily to monitor user activity.

### 💡 Incentive Mechanism

- Smart contracts come into play, rewarding active users with incentives.
- Users with consecutive active days receive rewards based on predefined criteria.

### 🚨 Trustworthiness Monitoring

- Companies are responsible for regular updates of users' login data.
- Failure to update login data is flagged, and companies may be deemed untrustworthy.
